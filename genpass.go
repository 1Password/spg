/** Attributes

	Attributes are all of the knobs that can be set for specifying details of what
	of the password requirements.

	There are two kinds of attributes (other than the Length). There are those that are
	specific for character type passwords and those that are relevant to things based
	on word lists. Ultimately we are sticking this all in the same type so that we
	can have a common Generator interface. So this gets kind of messy

// Password is what gets generated by the Generators
type Password struct {
	Tokens  []Token
	Entropy float32 // Entropy in bits of the Recipe from which this password was generated
}

// Generator is a fully configured password recipe
type Generator interface {
	Generate() (*Password, error)
	Entropy() float32
