1Password's Strong Password Generator package offers the underlying engine for flexible specification of generated password requirements and ensuring that the generated passwords it returns follow a uniform distribution.

The clients of this package are expected to manage what is presented to users. This engine offers far greater flexibility than should normally be exposed to users.

## Get started

Use `go get`:

```bash
go get go.1password.io/spg
